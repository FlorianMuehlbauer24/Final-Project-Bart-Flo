Final Project: Optimising hotel occupancy with machine learning and classic business analysis. 
(by looking at hotel booking and cancellation, creating predictions & segmenting customers and understanding booking patterns)

Data Analysts: Bartek and Florian

Dataset: Hotels Booking Data

Source: Kaggle, Link to Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khairullahhamsafar/hotels-booking-data-cleaned-version
Rows: 120k
Features: 30+

General task:
Refine the booking strategy, and offer personalized deals to strengthen customer loyalty and maximize business profits by optimizing occupancy
The best-performing models will be integrated into the hotel's operations to predict future cancellations and take appropriate actions to mitigate them.

HOW WE DO IT?

Business analysis

Reservations by month, hotel type
Average length of stay per customer type
Analysis of booking and cancellation rates (trends and patterns in booking and cancellation rates)
Root cause analysis for cancellations and optimization of the booking strategy
 
Machine learning

Segmentation of the customer base (classification)
Leverage data-driven solutions to reduce cancellations and enhance profitability
Behavioural segmentation: understand cancellation behaviour split per type
