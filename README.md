(Hotel Booking/Cancellation Prediction & Customer Segmentation)

Data Analysts: Bartek and Florian

Dataset: Hotels Booking Data

General task:
Refine the booking strategy, and offer personalized deals to strengthen customer loyalty and maximize business profits by optimizing occupancy
The best-performing models will be integrated into the hotel's operations to predict future cancellations and take appropriate actions to mitigate them.

HOW WE DO IT?

Business analysis

Reservations by month, hotel type
Average length of stay per customer type
Analysis of booking and cancellation rates (trends and patterns in booking and cancellation rates)
Root cause analysis for cancellations and optimization of the booking strategy
 
Machine learning

Prediction of last-minute bookings (linear regression)
The company wants to understand the demand for last-minute bookings to promote these bookings and increase capacity utilization.
Segmentation of the customer base (classification)
Leverage data-driven solutions to reduce cancellations and enhance profitability
Behavioral segmentation: understand which customer groups are most likely to cancellations (customer cancellation behavior)
Develop targeted customer retention and experience strategies to reduce cancellation rates. implement preventive measures
